Michelle first met Barack Obama when he came to work as a summer intern in June of 1989 at Sidley & Austin,
where she was already working as an attorney. <br><br>

When he asked her out, she first said no, because she thought it wasn’t appropriate for them to date. <br>
When he persisted, she asked her brother to play a game of basketball with him first <br>
because she'd grown up hearing her dad and Craig say you can tell a lot about a guy on the basketball court.
Robinson reported back that he could find no personality flaws with respect to the basketball evaluation.
<br>
Barack and Michelle started dating and got married in 1992.<br><br>
They then went on to have two daughters; Malia Ann (born 4 July, 1998) and Natasha “Sasha (born 7 June, 2001)
